# experienceBot
Documentation is a work in progress, bear with me. Everything, in terms of bot features, are discoverable with the help command.
For installing the bot, for now you will have to rely on searching the internet, it's not too complicated.

<sub>Yes, I know I should not commit everything to master like this repo has but this bot started as a meme before evolving into an actual functioning part of our group. It was also before most of my current knowledge of git branches was learned.</sub>
